# Telematic Services ðŸ’»ðŸ›œ
---
This repository contains the projects and implementations I will develop throughout the Telematic Services course as part of my Computer Engineering degree at UAO.

## Commits

The `main` branch will include all implementations made during the semester. Each commit will follow this format:

`|Topic - #Commit: Description|`, e.g., "DNS - #1: First Layer Implementation".

The `midterms` branch will contain files organized by the three academic periods.

Finally, the `project` branch will include project configurations (and, if possible, a description of the project).
